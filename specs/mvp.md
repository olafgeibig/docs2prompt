Thank you for your feedback. I'll revise the implementation plan based on your comments. Here's an updated version of the relevant sections:

## 1. Project Setup and Environment

### 1.1 Initialize Project Structure
- [x] Create a new directory for the project
- [x] Set up a poetry project
- [x] Initialize a git repository

### 1.2 Dependency Management
- [ ] Update `pyproject.toml` with essential libraries:
  - `pandoc` for universal document conversion
  - `click` for command-line interface
  - `pydantic` for data modeling
  - `sqlite3` for database management
- [ ] Research and add libraries for additional formats (e.g., reStructuredText)
- [ ] Investigate integration of pandoc for comprehensive file conversion

## 2. Core Functionality Development

### 2.1 Document Import and Conversion Module
- [ ] Create a `document_processor.py` file
- [ ] Implement functions to detect file types
- [ ] Develop conversion functions using pandoc for supported file types:
  - Word to Markdown
  - PDF to Markdown
  - Plain text to Markdown
  - reStructuredText to Markdown
  - Other formats as identified during research
- [ ] Implement a main `convert_to_markdown()` function that handles all types
- [ ] Add error handling for unsupported file types
- [ ] Create a fallback method for formats not supported by pandoc

### 2.2 Basic Token Optimization Module
- [ ] Create a `token_optimizer.py` file
- [ ] Implement basic text cleaning functions:
  - Remove extra whitespace
  - Standardize line breaks
- [ ] Develop content reduction techniques:
  - Remove redundant headers
  - Condense lists
  - Simplify complex sentences
- [ ] Implement a function to preserve code blocks and important formatting
- [ ] Create a main `optimize_content()` function that applies all optimization techniques

### 2.3 LLM-based Compression Research and Implementation
- [ ] Research LLM-based compression techniques
- [ ] Evaluate different approaches:
  - Fine-tuning existing models for compression
  - Prompt engineering for compression tasks
  - Investigating existing LLM-based summarization tools
- [ ] Prototype LLM-based compression function
- [ ] Implement error handling and fallback to basic optimization
- [ ] Integrate LLM-based compression into the main optimization pipeline
- [ ] Develop a method to balance compression ratio with information preservation

### 2.5 Command-Line Interface
- [ ] Create a `cli.py` file
- [ ] Use Click library to set up the CLI structure
- [ ] Implement commands:
  - `create`: Create a new prompt project
  - `run`: Execute a project and generate the prompt
  - `list`: Display all existing projects
  - `update`: Modify an existing project
  - `delete`: Remove a project
  - `count`: Count tokens in a generated prompt

These updates address your comments by:
1. Acknowledging the existing poetry project setup.
2. Incorporating pandoc for universal document conversion and adding support for more formats, including reStructuredText.
3. Adding a new subsection (2.3) for researching and implementing LLM-based compression.
4. Shortening the command names in the CLI section.

Is there anything else you'd like to modify or add to this revised plan?
