# Project docs2prompt
## Overview
Docs2Prompt is a versatile tool designed to convert documentation into token-efficient prompts for AI models, primarily targeting developers who need to create comprehensive coding agent prompts. It aims to bridge the gap between existing project documentation and AI assistance, enabling more context-aware and project-specific AI support during development tasks.

## Capabilities
1. Document Processing: Convert various documentation formats into a standardized, AI-friendly format.
2. Token Optimization: Compress and optimize content to maximize information density within token limits.
3. Prompt Generation: Create AI-model-agnostic prompts that encapsulate project-specific knowledge.
4. Project Management: Define and manage multiple prompt projects with version control.
5. Flexible Deployment: Offer both local (command line, GUI) and web service (Docker with HTML frontend) deployment options.
6. Performance Monitoring: Track and report on LLM token usage for each project.

## Use Cases
1. Pre-task Contextual Prompt Generation: Developers use Docs2Prompt to create a comprehensive prompt before starting a new coding task, ensuring the AI assistant has relevant project knowledge.
2. On-the-fly Assistant Configuration: During development, quickly generate or update prompts to refine AI assistance for specific challenges.
3. Project Onboarding: New team members use Docs2Prompt to quickly generate prompts that encapsulate project documentation, accelerating their onboarding process.
4. Documentation Updates: As project documentation evolves, developers can easily update their AI prompts to reflect the latest information.
5. Cross-project Knowledge Transfer: Developers working across multiple projects can create and manage separate prompts for each, ensuring context-appropriate AI assistance.

## Technical Concept

1. Architecture
   - Core Engine: Python-based backend for document processing, token optimization, and prompt generation
   - API Layer: RESTful API for interacting with the core engine
   - User Interfaces: Command-line interface (CLI) for MVP, future GUI and web interface

2. Document Processing
   - Use libraries like `python-docx` for Word documents, `PyPDF2` for PDFs, and `markdown` for Markdown files
   - Implement a modular design to easily add support for additional document types

3. Token Optimization
   - Utilize NLP libraries like NLTK or spaCy for text analysis and optimization
   - Implement custom algorithms for removing redundant information and compressing content

4. Prompt Generation
   - Design a flexible prompt template system using Jinja2 or a similar templating engine
   - Implement XML generation for Claude-compatible format

5. Project Management
   - Use SQLite for local storage of project metadata and versions
   - Implement Git-like versioning system for prompts

6. AI Model Abstraction
   - Design a plugin system for different AI model integrations
   - Implement a common interface for token counting across different models

7. Testing and Performance
   - Use pytest for unit and integration testing
   - Implement performance benchmarks for token optimization and prompt generation

8. Deployment
   - Package the application using setuptools for local installation
   - Create a Dockerfile for containerized deployment of the web service
